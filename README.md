# wk7_Pewlett_Hackard

## Overview of the analysis:
We will use this analysis to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Our analysis will help the company to prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results:
+ First step is to partition the data to find and remove duplicate rows.
+ A total of 90,398 titles are retiring from the company.
+ 57,668 Senior engineers and senior staff are the majority group among the retiring employees.
+ A total of 1549 existing employees are currently eligible for the mentorship program to fill in these retiring titles

## Summary:
Employees eligible for the mentorship program barely covers the gap of the eligible retirees.  If Pewlett-Hackard will compensate the lost by training from withing, they will need to widen the search parameter. Replacing the retirees internally or externally, will have to be planned and initiated ahead of time.  Hiring/Training employees could take time so measuring their productivity without going through the mentorship or training, could severely impact research and development, employer bottom line and eventually the employees themselves.
